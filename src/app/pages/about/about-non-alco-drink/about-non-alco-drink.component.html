    <h2>Non-Alcoholic Cocktails</h2>
    <p>"I’ve been obsessed with Seedlip ever since I came across it on the menu at Oxalis, in Brooklyn. My favorite non-alcoholic drink is actually from Oxalis’ menu, and it’s called Jasmine. It has just three ingredients: Seedlip grove, 'champagne acid,' and green tea. Perfectly balanced, a little fizzy, and not at all sweet. Goes with literally everything."</p>

    <h2>Bitters and Seltzer</h2>
    <p>I used to drink a truly revolting quantity of Diet Coke every day, but then I learned to love myself. I couldn’t quit the bubbles, though, and swapped over to unholy amounts of fizzy water and RIP my tooth enamel, but it’s still no doubt a healthier option. I mean, where does all that caramel coloring go? Anyhow, seltzer, soda, carbonated water, whatever is great and I could drink it in my sleep, but sometimes I like to add a little oomph with some bitters (Angostura is dandy, but I’ll switch it up to celery, rhubarb, or mixologist mustache hair bitters) and a squeeze of whatever citrus is around. I don’t care what kind; I’m a rebel and I’ll never ever be any good. Not that it’s anyone’s business what anyone else is putting in their mouth, but it looks like a cocktail if anyone is wondering and you don’t feel like answering questions about why you’re not drinking, and also bartenders understand it as a code for “I’m not drinking right now (or maybe ever—again, no one’s business), but I still wanna hang,” and they’ll make sure you’re hooked up all night, you bubble-loving maniac.</p>
